Welcome
=======

After this workshop you will be able to understand the basic concepts of ROS2, and 
program a robot using ROS2 with a minimal setup.

**Prerequisites**

These tutorials will assume you have a computer with a VSCode 
installed. If that is not the case, please follow the 
instructions below to set this up:

- `Installing VSCode <https://code.visualstudio.com/download>`_

In this training we will use the `MIRTE Pioneer <https://mirte.org/>`_ 
robot. 

**Context in right margin**

In this training we will use the right margin to give some context.
This can be the linux folder structure, terminal output os a certain
command, or ROS system overview.

For example, we could show the ouput of the current folder structure:

.. code-block:: console
   :class: margin

      /home
   >     /mirte

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd ~

Where the > shows the current working directory.
