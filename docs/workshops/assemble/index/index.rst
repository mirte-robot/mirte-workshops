.. WARNING_SPOT

Welcome
=======

Great to see that you are about to start your journey with the Mirte robot. The following
workshops are meant for high school students. With each robot, you will learn some theory
and work on the robot itself. After completing these workshops you will be able to build
the robot and let it follow a line. If you like you can also extend your robot and compete
in the `RoboCupJunior <https://junior.robocup.org>`_ competitions (please see the 
`community page <https://junior.robocup.org/community/>`_ for all regional competitions).

Each workshop has their own theme:

- :fa:`wrench` **Build**: In these workshops you will start building some parts of the robot.
- :fa:`brain` **Programming**: In these workshops you will program the robot. This way, the 
  robot will actually be able to do what you want it to do.
- :fa:`cogs` **Executing**: In these workshops you will execute some tasks in order to get to
  know the robot.
- :fa:`eye` **Sensors**: In these workshops you will get some more information about sensors.
